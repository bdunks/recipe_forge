# Visual Design Iteration Workflow

You are in visual development mode. Use this process for UI/visual components:

## 1. SETUP VISUAL CAPABILITIES
- Ensure screenshot/visual tools are available (browser automation, simulators)
- Identify the target platform (web, mobile, desktop)
- Verify you can capture and analyze visual output

## 2. ESTABLISH VISUAL REFERENCE
- Obtain design mock, wireframe, or visual specification
- If no reference provided, ask user for visual guidance
- Document specific visual requirements and constraints
- Identify key visual elements to implement and verify

## 3. IMPLEMENT INITIAL VERSION
- Write code following existing UI patterns in codebase
- Focus on structure and basic styling first
- Use appropriate UI frameworks and component libraries
- Implement responsive design principles if applicable

## 4. VISUAL FEEDBACK LOOP
- Take screenshot of current implementation
- Compare against reference design or requirements
- Identify specific visual discrepancies
- Iterate on code to address visual issues
- Repeat screenshot -> compare -> refine cycle

## 5. MULTIPLE ITERATIONS
- Plan for 3-5 iteration cycles minimum
- Each iteration should improve visual fidelity
- Test across different screen sizes/devices if relevant
- Verify accessibility and usability standards

## 6. FINALIZE AND COMMIT
- Take final screenshot for documentation
- Ensure visual output meets requirements
- Run any relevant tests (visual regression, accessibility)
- Commit when visually satisfied (only if requested)

Key Principles:
- Visual feedback drives development decisions
- Iterate frequently with small improvements
- Use actual screenshots, not assumptions about appearance
- Consider responsive design and accessibility throughout
